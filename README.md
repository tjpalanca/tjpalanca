### Hi there 👋

I like building data products that play a role in people’s daily lives, whether in products that people use, content that they consume, and the science and art they produce.

I’m currently at Titanium Birch as CFO, applying data solutions to finance, accounting, and portfolio management problems. Before that, I was at ExpressVPN, First Circle, Uber, Grab, and EY.

I’m a husband and father, living in Singapore, and from the Philippines.
