### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like building data products that play a role in peopleâ€™s daily lives, whether in products that people use, content that they consume, and the science and art they produce.

Iâ€™m currently at Titanium Birch as CFO, applying data solutions to finance, accounting, and portfolio management problems. Before that, I was at ExpressVPN, First Circle, Uber, Grab, and EY.

Iâ€™m a husband and father, living in Singapore, and from the Philippines.
